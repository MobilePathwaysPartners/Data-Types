 Below are two common Data Types a *variable* and a *constant*
 - A variable is denoted with the keyword *var* and can be changed
 - A constant is denoted with the keyword *let* and cannot be changed once it is declared
 
 Lets declare one of each and print them.

Normally the mixing of different data types is not allowed.
In the example below we have a constant label of type *String*

 This allows you and anyone else after you to easily understand what you were trying to accomplish in your code.
